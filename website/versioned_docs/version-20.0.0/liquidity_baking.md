# Liquidity Baking contract and Taquito

The goal of this document is to acquaint yourself with the different values in the storage of the contract as well as its entrypoints and the JavaScript code necessary to interact with them.

## Storage

The storage of the LB contract is made of 5 values:
- __tokenPool__: a value of type `nat` (i.e. a positive number) that represents the amount of tokens (in this case, tzBTC) held by the contract
- __mvrkPool__: a value of type `mumav` (i.e. an amount of mav) that represents the amount of MVRK held by the contract
- __lqtTotal__: a value of type `nat` that represents the amount of liquidity tokens (or LB tokens) the contract holds. The LB token is an FA1.2 token that represents a pair consisting of MVRK and tzBTC provided to the contract as liquidity
- __tokenAddress__: a value of type `address` (i.e. the address of an implicit account or a contract) that holds the address to the tzBTC contract
- __lqtAddress__Â : a value of type `address` that holds the address of the LB token

## Entrypoints

### Entrypoint parameters and purpose

### Interacting with the entrypoints with Taquito
The main friction point of interacting with the LB contract in JavaScript is about simulating the calculations of the expected token outputs Michelson does.

- __%tokenToMvrk__:
```ts
import { MavrykToolkit } from "@mavrykdynamics/taquito"

// to take into account the subsidy added to the LB contract
// when the transaction will be baked
const creditSubsidy = (mvrkPool: BigNumber | number): BigNumber => {
    const LIQUIDITY_BAKING_SUBSIDY = 2500000;
    if (BigNumber.isBigNumber(mvrkPool)) {
      return mvrkPool.plus(new BigNumber(LIQUIDITY_BAKING_SUBSIDY));
    } else {
      return new BigNumber(mvrkPool).plus(new BigNumber(LIQUIDITY_BAKING_SUBSIDY));
    }
  };

const tokenToMvrkMvrkOutput = (p: {
    tokenIn: BigNumber | number;
    mvrkPool: BigNumber | number;
    tokenPool: BigNumber | number;
  }): BigNumber | null => {
    const { tokenIn, mvrkPool: _mvrkPool, tokenPool } = p;
    let mvrkPool = creditSubsidy(_mvrkPool);
    let tokenIn_ = new BigNumber(0);
    let mvrkPool_ = new BigNumber(0);
    let tokenPool_ = new BigNumber(0);
    try {
      tokenIn_ = new BigNumber(tokenIn);
      mvrkPool_ = new BigNumber(mvrkPool);
      tokenPool_ = new BigNumber(tokenPool);
    } catch (err) {
      return null;
    }
    if (
      tokenIn_.isGreaterThan(0) &&
      mvrkPool_.isGreaterThan(0) &&
      tokenPool_.isGreaterThan(0)
    ) {
      // Includes 0.1% fee and 0.1% burn calculated separatedly:
      // 999/1000 * 999/1000 = 998001/1000000
      let numerator = new BigNumber(tokenIn)
        .times(new BigNumber(mvrkPool))
        .times(new BigNumber(998001));
      let denominator = new BigNumber(tokenPool)
        .times(new BigNumber(1000000))
        .plus(new BigNumber(tokenIn).times(new BigNumber(999000)));
      return numerator.dividedBy(denominator);
    } else {
      return null;
    }
};

const Mavryk = new MavrykToolkit(RPC_URL);
const lbContract = await Mavryk.wallet.at(LB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
// the deadline value is arbitrary and can be changed
const deadline = new Date(Date.now() + 60000).toISOString();
const tzBtcContract = await Mavryk.wallet.at(TZBTC_ADDRESS);
const tokensSold = AMOUNT_IN_TZBTC;
const minMvrkBought = tokenToMvrkMvrkOutput({
    tokenIn: tokensSold,
    mvrkPool,
    tokenPool
  }).toNumber();

let batch =Mavryk.wallet.batch()
    .withContractCall(tzBtcContract.methodsObject.approve({ spender: lbContractAddress, value: 0}))
    .withContractCall(
        tzBtcContract.methodsObject.approve({ spender: lbContractAddress, value: tokensSold })
    )
    .withContractCall(
        lbContract.methodsObject.tokenToMvrk({
            to: USER_ADDRESS,
            tokensSold,
            minMvrkBought,
            deadline
        })
    );
const batchOp = await batch.send();
await batchOp.confirmation();
```

This code sends a transaction to the `%tokenToMvrk` entrypoint of the contract to exchange tzBTC tokens for MVRK. After the amount of tzBTC to exchange is provided in the `AMOUNT_IN_TZBTC` variable, the expected output in MVRK is calculated using the `tokenToMvrkMvrkOutput` function. This value is then stored in the `minMvrkBought` variable before being used with the provided amount in tzBTC to forge a transaction and exchange tzBTC tokens for MVRK.

> Note: the different numeric values used for the MVRK and tzBTC amounts, as well as for the MVRK and tzBTC pools are raw values that are not formatted with their decimal point. Be careful not to use formatted values meant for display only that could throw off the results of the calculations.

- __%mvrkToToken__:
```ts
import { MavrykToolkit, OpKind } from "@mavrykdynamics/taquito"

// outputs the amount of tzBTC tokens for a given amount of MVRK
const mvrkToTokenTokenOutput = (p: {
    mvrkIn: BigNumber | number;
    mvrkPool: BigNumber | number;
    tokenPool: BigNumber | number;
}): BigNumber | null => {
    let { mvrkIn, mvrkPool: _mvrkPool, tokenPool } = p;

    let mvrkPool = creditSubsidy(_mvrkPool);
    let mvrkIn_ = new BigNumber(0);
    let mvrkPool_ = new BigNumber(0);
    let tokenPool_ = new BigNumber(0);
    try {
      mvrkIn_ = new BigNumber(mvrkIn);
      mvrkPool_ = new BigNumber(mvrkPool);
      tokenPool_ = new BigNumber(tokenPool);
    } catch (err) {
      return null;
    }
    if (
      mvrkIn_.isGreaterThan(0) &&
      mvrkPool_.isGreaterThan(0) &&
      tokenPool_.isGreaterThan(0)
    ) {
      // Includes 0.1% fee and 0.1% burn calculated separatedly: 999/1000 * 999/1000 = 998100/1000000
      // (mvrkIn_ * tokenPool_ * 999 * 999) / (tokenPool * 1000 - tokenOut * 999 * 999)
      const numerator = mvrkIn_.times(tokenPool_).times(new BigNumber(998001));
      const denominator = mvrkPool_
        .times(new BigNumber(1000000))
        .plus(mvrkIn_.times(new BigNumber(998001)));
      return numerator.dividedBy(denominator);
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  };

const Mavryk = new MavrykToolkit(RPC_URL);
const lbContract = await Mavryk.wallet.at(LB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
// the deadline value is arbitrary and can be changed
const deadline = new Date(Date.now() + 60000).toISOString();
const minTokensBought = mvrkToTokenTokenOutput({
    mvrkIn: mvrkAmountInMumav,
    mvrkPool,
    tokenPool
  }).toNumber();

const op = await lbContract.methodsObject.mvrkToToken({
    to: USER_ADDRESS,
    minTokensBought,
    deadline
}).send();
await op.confirmation();
```

This code sends a transaction to the `%mvrkToToken` entrypoint of the contract to exchange MVRK for tzBTC tokens. The `mvrkToTokenTokenOutput` function is used to calculate the minimum amount of tzBTC tokens that can be expected when exchanging the given amount of MVRK.

> Note: the `mvrkToTokenTokenOutput` uses the `creditSubsidy` function introduced in the previous piece of code.

- __%addLiquidity__:
```ts
import { MavrykToolkit, OpKind } from "@mavrykdynamics/taquito"

const Mavryk = new MavrykToolkit(RPC_URL);
const lbContract = await Mavryk.wallet.at(LB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
const tzBtcContract = await Mavryk.wallet.at(TZBTC_ADDRESS);
const maxTokensSold = Math.floor(
    AMOUNT_IN_TZBTC + (AMOUNT_IN_TZBTC * slippage) / 100
);
const minLqtMinted = Math.floor((AMOUNT_IN_MVRK * lqtTotal) / mvrkPool);
// the deadline value is arbitrary and can be changed
const deadline = new Date(Date.now() + 60000).toISOString();

const batchOp = await Mavryk.wallet
.batch([
    {
        kind: OpKind.TRANSACTION,
        ...tzBtcContract.methodsObject
          .approve({ spender: LB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, value: 0 })
          .toTransferParams()
    },
    {
        kind: OpKind.TRANSACTION,
        ...tzBtcContract.methodsObject
          .approve({ spender: LB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, value: maxTokensSold })
          .toTransferParams()
    },
    {
        kind: OpKind.TRANSACTION,
        ...lbContract.methodsObject
          .addLiquidity({
            owner: USER_ADDRESS,
            minLqtMinted: minLqtMinted - 3,
            maxTokensDeposited: maxTokensSold,
            deadline
          })
          .toTransferParams(),
        amount: AMOUNT_IN_MVRK,
        mumav: true
    },
    {
        kind: OpKind.TRANSACTION,
        ...tzBtcContract.methodsObject
          .approve({ spender: LB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, value: 0 })
          .toTransferParams()
        }
])
.send();
await batchOp.confirmation();
```

The `%addLiquidity` entrypoint is probably the most complex one to interact with.
The maximum amount of tzBTC tokens to be sold is calculated using this formula: `AMOUNT_IN_TZBTC + (AMOUNT_IN_TZBTC * slippage) / 100`

- __%removeLiquidity__:
```ts
import { MavrykToolkit } from "@mavrykdynamics/taquito"

const calculateLqtOutput = ({
  lqTokens,
  mvrkPool,
  tzbtcPool,
  lqtTotal
}: {
  lqTokens: number;
  mvrkPool: number;
  tzbtcPool: number;
  lqtTotal: number;
}): { mvrk: number; tzbtc: number } => {
    const mvrkOut = (+lqTokens * (mvrkPool)) / lqtTotal
    const tzbtcOut = (+lqTokens * (tzbtcPool)) / lqtTotal

    return {
        mvrk: mvrkOut,
        tzbtc: tzbtcOut
    };
};

const Mavryk = new MavrykToolkit(RPC_URL);
const lbContract = await Mavryk.wallet.at(LB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
// the deadline value is arbitrary and can be changed
const deadline = new Date(Date.now() + 60000).toISOString();
const { mvrkOut, tzbtcOut } = calculateLqtOutput(
    {
        lqTokens,
        mvrkPool,
        tzbtcPool,
        lqtTotal
    }
);

const op = await lbContract.methodsObject
    .removeLiquidity({
        to: USER_ADDRESS,
        lqtBurned: amountInLqt,
        minMvrkWithdrawn: mvrkOut,
        minTokensWithdrawn: tzBtcOut,
        deadline
    })
    .send();
await op.confirmation();
```

- __%tokenToToken__:
The `%tokenToToken` entrypoint is meant to be used on-chain as an intermediary between 2 contracts. Although it's possible to send a transaction to the entrypoint, its use off-chain is redundant and the same effect can be obtained by calling `%tokenToMvrk` followed by `%mvrkToToken`.
