`@mavrykdynamics/taquito-rpc` is an npm package that provides low-level methods and types to invoke RPC calls from a Nomadic Mavryk RPC node.

## General Information

The RPC package can be used to query the RPC API of your chosen node. Methods in the RPC package map one-to-one to the corresponding Mavryk RPC API endpoints. All responses from the RPC are returns with TypeScript types.

The higher-level `@mavrykdynamics/taquito` package builds on this RPC package.

## Install

```
npm i --save @mavrykdynamics/taquito-rpc
```

## Usage
### RpcClient

The constructor of the `RpcClient` takes an RPC URL as a parameter and an optional chain (default is main).

```ts
import { RpcClient } from '@mavrykdynamics/taquito-rpc';

const client = new RpcClient('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');

// Fetching the balance of an account in mumav (micro Íù≥)
const balance = await client.getBalance('mv1Hox9jGJg3uSmsv9NTvuK7rMHh25cq44nv');
```

### RpcClientCache

The `RpcClientCache` class aims to improve the performance of dApps built using Taquito by reducing the number of calls made to the RPC. Its constructor takes a RpcClient instance as a parameter and an optional ttl (time to live). The RpcClient responses will be cached for the period defined by the ttl (default is of 1000 milliseconds). The `RpcClientCache` can be injected to the MavrykToolkit as follow:

```ts
import { MavrykToolkit } from '@mavrykdynamics/taquito';
import { RpcClient, RpcClientCache } from '@mavrykdynamics/taquito-rpc';

const rpcClient = new RpcClient('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
const mavryk = new MavrykToolkit(new RpcClientCache(rpcClient));
```
